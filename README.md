# CS-305-Software-Security--Portfolio

- Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons. The company seeks to protect the organization from external threats and to modernize its operations.

- What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

I particularly did well in analyzing the code and following the vulnerability assessment process flow. I was able to successfuly analize input validation, APIs,cryptography, client/server, code errors, code quality and encapsulation. Secure code will help to prevent many cyber-attacks from happening because it removes the vulnerabilities many exploits rely on.

- What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

Learning how to use the tools to find vulnerabilities was definetly challeging, but I was able to quickly learn how to perform vulnerability tests and how to indentify false positives and false negatives. 

- How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

- How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

A good way to ensure that the code are functional and secure is to follow the OWASP Secure Coding Guidelines and testing Input Validation, Output Encoding, Authentication, Password Management, Access Control, Cryptographic Practices, Error Handling, Logging Data Protection, Communication Security, System Configuration, Database Security, File Management, and Memory Management.

- What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

As I stated above the OWASP secure coding guidelines helped me to ensure that the code was secure during the development of the project. Addtionally, I would use maven plugin to check project's dependencies to see if they have any known published vulnerabilities.

- Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I would like to show my understanding about software security and the process of how I conducted tests to indentify any type of vulnerabilities.
